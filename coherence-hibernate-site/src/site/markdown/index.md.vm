<h4>Overview</h4>

The Oracle Coherence Hibernate Integration project encompasses the code of integration points between Hibernate and
Oracle Coherence.  Separate [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) modules are used to isolate the code of each
distinct integration point.

Currently the set of integration points consists of the following:

<ol>
<li>A Hibernate-based implementation of the Coherence CacheStore SPI. This CacheStore implementation is pre-existing
and merely moved from the Coherence product codebase.</li>
<li>A Coherence-based implementation of the Hibernate second-level cache SPI.  This implementation represents new
development targeted to the redesigned SPI released in Hiberate 3.3.</li>
</ol>

Complete source code together with documentation is provided to aid in adoption, use and understanding.
