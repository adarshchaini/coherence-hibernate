Welcome to Coherence Hibernate Integration
==========================================

[Coherence Hibernate Integration](http://coherence-community.github.com/coherence-hibernate-integration/1.0-SNAPSHOT/)
implements integration points between Oracle Coherence and the Hibernate
object/relational mapping framework from JBoss.org.  Two primary integration
points are covered currently: using Coherence as a second-level cache in
Hibernate; and using Hibernate as a Coherence CacheStore implementation.
