Welcome to Oracle Coherence Hibernate Integration
=================================================

The Oracle Coherence Hibernate project implements integration points between Oracle Coherence and the Hibernate
object/relational mapping framework from JBoss.org.  

Two primary integration points are covered currently: using Coherence as a second-level cache in
Hibernate; and using Hibernate as a Coherence CacheStore implementation.

Detailed project documentation for the latest release (1.0.0) is available
here: [http://coherence-community.github.io/coherence-hibernate-integration/1.0.0/](http://coherence-community.github.io/coherence-hibernate-integration/1.0.0/)
