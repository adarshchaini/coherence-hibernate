Coherence Hibernate CacheStore
==============================

This page describes how you can use Hibernate as the implementation of a Coherence CacheStore.

<h3>Installing the Coherence Hibernate CacheStore</h3>

Installing the Coherence Hibernate second-level cache implementation amounts to obtaining a distribution of
`coherence-hibernate-cache-store-${project.version}.jar` and making it available to JVM ClassLoaders.  The easiest way to do
so is to build and execute your Hibernate application with Maven, and add the following dependency to your applicationâ€™s
`pom.xml`:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.oracle.coherence.hibernate</groupId>
        <artifactId>coherence-hibernate-cache-store</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
    </dependency>

Alternatively, you can download `coherence-hibernate-cache-store-${project.version}.jar` from a Maven repository (e.g.
<https://maven.java.net>) and use it in JVM classpaths.  Or you can [build](building.html) the Coherence Hibernate
CacheStore implementation from sources.

Note that the Coherence Hibernate CacheStore implementation depends at runtime on an installation of Oracle
Coherence, and an installation of Hibernate.  These dependencies are most easily managed using Maven.  You can install
Coherence artifacts into your Maven repository as documented here:
