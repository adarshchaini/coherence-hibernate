Welcome to Oracle Coherence Hibernate Integration
=================================================

The [Oracle Coherence Hibernate Integration](http://coherence-community.github.com/coherence-hibernate-integration/${project.version}/)
project implements integration points between Oracle Coherence and the Hibernate
object/relational mapping framework from JBoss.org.  Two primary integration
points are covered currently: using Coherence as a second-level cache in
Hibernate; and using Hibernate as a Coherence CacheStore implementation.
