Building
--------

To build the Oracle Coherence Hibernate Integration project you need to have the following software installed:

1.  Java SE Development Kit 6, 7 or 8.

    Available from: [Oracle Java SE Downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

2.  [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) Version 3.0.4 (not 3.0.3)

    Available here: [Apache Maven Downloads](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

3.  The [source code](source-code.html).

Once you have these installed building the entire source tree is as simple as executing the following shell command
(from the root of the source directory):

    $ mvn clean install

However the fact that the Oracle Coherence Hibernate Integration depends on a commercial product, namely
[Oracle Coherence](http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/coherence/index.html) which is not available in a public
Maven Repository, probably means that your first build is likely to fail because of a missing dependency on
`coherence.jar`.

Should this problem occur you will need to manually install a suitable `coherence.jar` into your local repository or
your organization's repository manager.

With Coherence 12.1.2 and later, there is a Maven plugin for sync'ing jar files in a Coherence installation to your
Maven repository, as documented here: <http://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1212/coherence/COHDG/gs_install.htm#A7113537>.

For Coherence versions older than 12.1.2, to install `coherence.jar` into your local Apache Maven repository, simply
change to the `$COHERENCE_HOME/lib` directory and run the following command:

    $ mvn install:install-file  \
          -DgroupId=com.oracle.coherence  \
          -DartifactId=coherence  \
          -Dversion=3.7.1.9  \
          -Dfile=coherence.jar  \
          -Dpackaging=jar \
          -DgeneratePom=true

The `groupId`, `artifactId` and `version` are critically important.  They must be as indicated above otherwise the
Oracle Coherence Hibernate Integration project won't build.

Of course the above assumes that you are installing the Coherence 3.7.1.9 `jar` file. If you want to install a different
release, change the version number in the command above accordingly.

Once a `coherence.jar` is properly installed into your Maven repository by one of the above methods, you should be able
to build the Oracle Coherence Hibernate Integration project.
